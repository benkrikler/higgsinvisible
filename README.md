#VBF invisble k-factor producer

##Introduction

This framework produces the k-factors used in the CMS Run 2 Higgs to Invisible analysis, as well as some generator level control distributions.
In addition to this README, the code is commented throughout.

The `master` branch contains everything necessary to produce the k-factors.

The `version-0.9` branch contains an older version, not fully described, but has more features and studies.
The output for the functions common to `master` will be the same though.

##Initial setup

The code should work with most versions of `ROOT` and/or `CMSSW`. It has only been fully tested with `CMSSW_9_4_10` and `CMSSW_10_1_7` though.

To compile simply type: `make`

The code is then split into two parts. The initial program called `FillHistograms` is run like:

-  `FillHistograms --filein path_to_input_root_file --fileout path_to_output_root_file`

This creates a class instance of `HiggsInvisible`, which in turn calls the functions in `src/Histogramming.cxx` (where the majority of the code is housed).
These functions perform a generator level selection (including identifying the correct boson), and fills `ROOT` histograms, which are stored in the output `ROOT` file.

Normally you will want to run `FillHistograms` over all samples, so there is a script `submit.py` provided, which will submit all of the relevant samples to the Imperial batch system. Run like:

-  `./submit.py`

You will need to change the `outputpath`, the `cmsswdir` and the `analysisdir` variables to ones corresponding to your system.

Finally when all jobs are completed you need to run:

-  `./merge.py`

This will merge (`hadd`) all individuial `ROOT` output files, so there is exactly one for each initial dataset. Note that `merge.py` merges the same files that are listed in `submit.py` (i.e. it imports the list of datasets from `submit.py`).
